        <div class="subheading mb-5">Sociology MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Amaris Thompson and I am currently a first year sociology major at UCR. I was born in Riverside Ca, and have lived here my whole life. I would like to explore cities and states outside of Riverside when I graduate college. I hope to graduate college with a bachelorâ€™s degree with a high gpa and work towards a career I love. I hope to be able to help people all around the world and let them know that they are not alone. Knowing there are people suffering and thinking there is not a solution for what they are going through inspires me to want to be there for them and let them know there will be a solution. I would also like to assist children and give them the happiness they deserve. I aspire to be a marriage/family therapist to help families who are willing to fight for what they love. I have experienced family struggles and watched marriages not survive and I see the effect it has on everyone inside the family. I hope to one day help those families who donâ€™t think anything can fix their relationship and toxicity. I want them to know they arenâ€™t alone and by seeking therapy they are already one step closer to fixing themselves. I believe that anyone can fix something if they truly fight for it. Outside of my future career, I am an artist and enjoy creating new things. I graduated high school with a 3.89 gpa and was on the varsity softball team from my freshman to junior year. I have received multiple letters and awards, just being a student-athlete and balancing the two. By this, I consider myself to be good at managing my time, and balancing or multi-tasking. In my free time when I am not in school I enjoy reading. I love to read about things I can relate to and I find myself writing on my own. When I find myself relating to something, I realize that there are other people going through the same things as me and this inspires me to write something they can relate to. Knowing I have helped people know that their feelings are valid is something that I enjoy. If a career as a marriage and family therapist does not work out for me, I would like to write. Whether it is poetry or books, I just want to write things that I know people will find comforting to read and calm their feelings. Overall, I want people to know that they are not alone and that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and a solution to their problems. I have already written many poems that have received lots of views, where people tell me that my words have comforted them. All around the country, there are people who are going through those situations I was once in and they are happy knowing that happiness can one day come from their sadness.
